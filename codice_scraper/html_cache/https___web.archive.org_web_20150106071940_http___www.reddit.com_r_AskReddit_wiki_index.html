<h3 id="wiki_what_is_reddit_and_how_does_it_work.3F">What is Reddit and how does it work?</h3>
<p>Reddit is a website comprised of thousands of user-originated and operated communities, called &#39;subreddits&#39;, or &#39;subs&#39;, dedicated to a variety of interests.  Some of these subreddits allow for posting of pictures, videos, articles, and other links, while others allow for only &#39;self-posts&#39;, posts that do not redirect away from the page.  The website as a whole is operated by the &#39;Administrators&#39;, or &#39;Admins&#39;, who oversee the official business operations. Subreddits are operated by &#39;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/wiki/moderation" rel="nofollow">Moderators</a>&#39;, or &#39;Mods&#39;, who perform a variety of functions within that community, including removing spam and determining and enforcing the rules of their subreddit.</p>
<p>Posts and comments accrue votes, or points, called &#39;karma&#39;.  <strong>To discourage outside monitoring and spamming, the system fuzzes the karma count on posts to a degree.</strong>  The ratio of upvotes and downvotes tends to be muddied a little (and roughly sits around +65% on popular posts), but this does not affect the sorting. A top post is still a top post.</p>
<p>Karma is generally a measure of the perception of your contribution to reddit. Positive karma would indicate your fellow users regarded your comments or posts as enjoyable and contributory to the subreddit.  It is otherwise meaningless, you can&#39;t <em>use</em> it for anything, so there&#39;s no real reason to try to acquire it. Your primary focus should really be just participating in the various communities and enjoying yourself and the interaction with your fellow redditors. </p>
<p>There are two types of karma: &#39;Link karma&#39; and &#39;comment karma&#39;. Link karma is only given to posts that redirect away from that reddit page, links to other subreddits or other domains.  Self-posts are not awarded link karma.  &#39;Comment karma&#39; is the karma awarded to comments. The count is not always an up-to-the-minute score of your various comments, as the internal system doesn&#39;t always keep up immediately, but it will get there soon enough.  Sometimes, technical issues will cause the karma score to lag, as well as other issues with visibility of posting an comments, but these are usually sorted out quickly enough.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq" rel="nofollow"><strong>Official Reddit FAQ</strong></a> and the <a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq" rel="nofollow"><strong>/r/Help FAQ</strong></a> go into a much more in-depth explanation of reddit and any further questions you may have.</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="wiki_what_is_askreddit.3F">What is AskReddit?</h1>
<p>AskReddit is a default subreddit, meaning you are automatically subscribed to it when you create your account.  The focus of this subreddit is to ask and answer questions that elicit thought-provoking discussions, as well as some lighter questions which will hopefully entertain and help you learn a little about your fellow redditors. </p>
<p>Only self posts are allowed, and we prefer your questions to shine the focus on a topic other than yourself.  If you wish to tell a story, or seek advice pertaining to you or your situation, please consider posting in another subreddit first if it might be more appropriate elsewhere. Additionally, if you&#39;re seeking feedback from a specific demographic or profession, search to see if there is a specific subreddit dedicated to that field. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search" rel="nofollow"><strong>Subreddit Search</strong></a> or <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit" rel="nofollow">/r/findareddit</a></strong> can help you with that.</p>
<p>We currently have over 6.2 million subscribers, and that number is constantly rising by several thousand each day. Because of this, we average nearly 2 million unique hits a day, and over 150 million pageviews per month. You can see our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic" rel="nofollow">full traffic stats here</a></p>

<h1 id="wiki_rules">Rules</h1>
<p><strong>Rules of the subreddit:</strong>  Every subreddit has a unique set of rules regarding posting, comments, and general behavior acceptable there.  These are typically listed in the sidebar, often along with the FAQs and other recommended sites or subreddits. Please take note of them in every subreddit you visit.</p>
<p>The rules for AskReddit are as follows:</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_1-">-Rule 1-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. a)</strong> You must post a clear and direct question, <strong>and only the question, in your title.</strong> Any context, clarification, or conditions should be posted in the text box.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to tag your post NSFW, either put <strong>only</strong> the letters &#39;NSFW&#39; before or after the post, or use the tagger button.  Introductory statements or claims,  &#39;baiting&#39;  devices like &#39;Possibly NSFW&#39;, or non question-related information such as &#39;I&#39;ll start...&#39; are a violation of this rule, and will result in the post being removed. You need to have a question mark in your question and titles containing more than one sentence will likely be removed. </p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> <strong>Any answers to the question, including your own, should go in the comments as a reply to your own post.</strong> Use the text box to explain your question if necessary, but do not use it to share an answer. This is to allow for users to distinguish between the question being asked, and its answers, when voting.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_2-">-Rule 2-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2)</strong>  Any post asking for advice should be <strong>generic</strong> and <strong>not specific to your situation alone</strong>. You may include context about why you are asking the question in the text box, <strong>but the question shouldn&#39;t be primarily about you</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p>In AskReddit, your title should always be about the question itself. If the question is focused on your personal story or is only relevant to your experience, it is not suitable for AskReddit. If you wish to receive advice on a specific topic, there are several options listed in the sidebar. </p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_3-">-Rule 3-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions</strong>. Questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls and surveys, etc.) are not appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not a replacement for google. We are here to engage in constructive and entertaining discussion. Posts that do not promote such qualities may be removed. Crowdsourcing naming decisions, purchases, etc, is not appropriate. Either/or, <a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/wouldyourather" rel="nofollow">&quot;would you rather&quot;</a>, or A/B posts also constitute as polls. Also prohibited are posts seeking to compile NSFW-links (as top-level comments). Such posts are not conducive to active discussion, and there are other subreddits where they would be more appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_4-">-Rule 4-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>4) Posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information will result in a ban without a prior warning. This includes for yourself or other people, and refers to, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook or other social media accounts.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of intent, posting any information under the premise of being personally identifiable information is prohibited, and the person posting the information will be banned from the subreddit. This is a protective measure, because we cannot verify the accuracy of what is posted, nor defend against any unsavory intentions other users might have. </p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_5-">-Rule 5-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>5) AskReddit is not your soapbox, personal army, or advertising platform.</strong> Posts attempting to promote a specific agenda of yours or anyone else, to gain publicity, promote a cause or charity drive, or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed.  Rhetorical and loaded questions will also be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#39;t a place to recruit members for a cause, highlight an individual or entity for positive or negative publicity, or toot your own horn.  Also, do not make posts or edits asking for upvotes or downvotes. Attempting to gain support for a movement, rig a contest, or form a vote brigade on reddit will result in immediate post removal. We&#39;re not here to do your bidding.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_6-">-Rule 6-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>6)</strong> <strong>Questions seeking professional advice are inappropriate for this subreddit and will be removed.</strong> This includes but is not limited to medical, legal, mental health and financial advice. If you think that you need professional support, please contact a professional in your area as the qualifications of anyone giving advice on reddit can not be verified.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it&#39;s serious enough for you to ask Reddit, it&#39;s serious enough for you to see a professional about it. </p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_7-">-Rule 7-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>7) Soliciting money, goods, services, or favors are not allowed. They will be removed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This ties back in with rules 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Gaining publicity for a charity drive, assistance with a homework or work assignment, or asking other redditors to provide you with a good or service, is not conducive to discussion. There are other subreddits, many listed in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/user/AskReddit_Multis/m/offers_assistance" rel="nofollow"><strong>Offers &amp; Assistance Multi-reddit</strong></a>, for just such a thing.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_8-">-Rule 8-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>8) Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users&#39; posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.</strong> All users are expected to be <strong>respectful</strong> to other users at all times. Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that this is a site on the internet that hosts anonymous users.  Thick skin is required.</p>
<p>That said, don&#39;t be abusive or harass other users. If it is deemed that your conduct is detrimental to the experience of other users, your posting privileges will be revoked. Unmarked NSFW pictures, spam, and the likes will also be removed.  </p>
<p>Bans may be issued to users who disregard this rule.   </p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_9-">-Rule 9-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>9) Comment replies consisting solely of images will be removed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Child comments (comment replies to other comments), that consist only of a link to an image/video will be removed.  Links as part of a larger sentence giving context will still be permitted.  For example, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[random sentence made a link](<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reaction.gif/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reaction.gif</a>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.imgur.com/jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imgur.com/jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will be removed, but a comment like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is an example of a comment containing a [link](<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.imgur.com/jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imgur.com/jpg</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will still be permitted. This is to prevent long chains of pictures, videos, or gifs that derail and detract from the conversation more than they contribute or progress it. Askreddit is a self-post only community focusing on discussion, and such comment replies only serve to derail the conversation, and are often &#39;spam&#39; in nature.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_10-">-Rule 10-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>10) If you think your post has disappeared, see spam or an inappropriate post, please do not hesitate to contact one of the mods, we&#39;re happy to help.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The community works much better when everyone works together to keep the place running smooth as possible. </p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="wiki_thread_tags">Thread Tags</h1>
<p>Askreddit is working on expanding tags, or &#39;link flair&#39; to designate certain posts as having certain topics or qualities.  These will come with a colored tag that expands to explain a little more when you mouse over the bar on the side. Unfortunately this is a product of the CSS, so many mobile apps and users with the Subreddit Style turned off will be unable to see this, however the tag will usually be put in the title in [brackets] as well, for easy indication to those unable to see the CSS.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_--.5Bserious.5D_tags--">--[Serious] Tags--</h2>
<p>This tag designates the thread is is applied to as a serious post, off-limits for joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion. If the OP asks for answers from a specific group, top level comments must be made from members of that group. Other responses will be removed. To mark your thread as [Serious], simply put &#39;[Serious]&#39;, in brackets, in the post title. AutoModerator will automatically assign the link flair, thoroughly indicating with both thread title and flair, that the post will be much more strictly moderated and that comments not pertaining to the discussion in a more serious manner are subject to removal. If you see an inappropriate comment in a [Serious] thread, please downvote and report it so that the mods can look it over.  Note that the &#39;report&#39; button is not an &#39;I disagree&#39; button or a super-downvote, it will simply flag it for the mods&#39; attention, and the comment will be evaluated for removal then. Not every thread will be appropriate for a [Serious] tag, and may be removed if assigned inappropriately, and not every comment will warrant removal, but the mods will use their best discretion to determine the value of the content posted. </p>
<h2 id="wiki_--.5Bstories.5D_tags--">--[Stories] Tags--</h2>
<p>This tag designates that the OP has asked for users to post detailed stories as top-level comments. The comment length is determined by character count (currently set at 750 characters, but may change as necessary), and is enforced by Automod.   To tag your post with this this tag, simply put &#39;[Stories]&#39;, in brackets, in the title.  Automod will automatically assign the flair and begin enforcing the character count on post replies.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2cqygu/modpost_announcing_a_new_type_of_post_stories/" rel="nofollow">See the Modpost about it here for further information</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_--breaking_news.2C_megathreads.2C_and_mod_posts--">--Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts--</h2>
<p>The Breaking News tag and the Megathread tag is for mod use only and is used when a breaking news happens or an event is going on, respectively. These tags are used when the mods need to pool together questions in a single post so the sub doesn&#39;t get filled with posts about one specific subject. The reason for this is that a lot of users do not come to AskReddit for current events and many want the sub to function as normal without having to filter posts -- we do this as a way to cater to both sides, as people who want information on the current event can visit the Breaking News or Megathread post and the people who don&#39;t are able to browse the sub as they normally would. Mod Posts are for sub announcements which usually involve rule changes or asking for feedback. Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts are exempt from rule 1 and 2 as they serve a separate purpose to the sub compared to regular posts.</p>
<p>In Breaking News posts, users can post thoughts, questions and comments anywhere in the thread, the same applies to Mod Posts. In Megathreads, top-level comments are required to be questions and the top-level comments are meant to function as mini threads within the Megathread which is meant to be like a subreddit for that specific subject. The mods run Megathreads throughout the year. Examples are the Christmas, Halloween and back to school Megathreads. None of the Megathreads are considered [Serious] posts unless it is marked as such in the title. </p>

<h1 id="wiki_tips_and_tricks">Tips and Tricks</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Please</em> avoid &#39;shotgunning&#39; comments and &#39;karmafarming&#39;</strong>-    Both of these behaviors can constitute comment-spamming, which is against the sitewide rules on spamming, and can result a ban from the subreddit.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regarding bots and novelty accounts</strong>:  Bots are not permitted in <a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit" rel="nofollow">/r/askreddit</a>.  By their nature, they are incapable of progressing the discussion because they are not active participants capable of offering different responses.  They are considered spam, even the &#39;helpful&#39; ones, because they create more static noise in the thread than they contribute.  Novelty accounts are discouraged, and certain kinds of novelties are banned.  Novelties that make identical comments (like the &#39;only says lol&#39; type) are considered spam for the same reasons bots are.  Novelties that are dynamic, can contribute to and progress the conversation by offering some degree of &#39;original content&#39; are permitted. </p></li>
<li><p>Questions soliciting binary &quot;this or that&quot; answers including questions asking &quot;how many...&quot; <strong>do not make good questions</strong>. A good rule to live by is, &quot;Is there any conceivable way that I could answer this in only 5 characters?&quot; If the answer is yes, then you may want to revise your question. </p></li>
<li><p>Editing your post because you made it to the front page, or were gifted gold, or received more upvotes than ever before is <em>not</em> obligatory, please don&#39;t do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific interests will likely have dedicated subreddits. Indeed, there are subreddits for everything.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/ModeratorDuck/wiki/subreddit_classification" rel="nofollow"><strong>Here is just a taste of all the various subreddits out there</strong></a>.  If you don&#39;t see something there that fits your interests, and can&#39;t find it in the sidebar of any subreddit, the subreddit <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit" rel="nofollow">/r/findareddit</a></strong> might be able to help. </p></li>
<li><p>If you have a question for a specific demographic of people, be it profession or geographic location, search to see if there is a specific subreddit for them. For examples, there is a <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/teachers" rel="nofollow">/r/teachers</a></strong> for teachers, or <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/military" rel="nofollow">/r/military</a></strong> for all things military.  Nearly every sizable location has a subreddit, too, including <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas" rel="nofollow">/r/LasVegas</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/NYC" rel="nofollow">/r/NYC</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/London" rel="nofollow">/r/London</a></strong>, etc.  Even whole states and countries have subreddits dedicated to them. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search" rel="nofollow"><strong>subreddit search</strong></a> or <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit" rel="nofollow">/r/findareddit</a></strong> can help you locate the most relevant one, and many subreddits also plug related subreddits in their sidebar, so be sure to take note of those as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Searching by keyword in the search box can return popular posts made in the past.  You can narrow the results by time frame (day/week/month/year/all time), as well as sort by certain post criteria(relevance, new, top, comments).  The answer or discussion you&#39;re looking for may already be in one of those threads, or it can just be fun to revisit past topics. You can also take a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/commonquestions" rel="nofollow"><strong>some of the most commonly asked questions</strong></a> to find out whether your question has already been asked.</p></li>
<li><p>You can browse subreddits several different ways. You can start on the front page, which shows the current most popular threads, or you can browse in the /New/ queue.  The &#39;rising&#39; sorting in the /New/ queue shows current trending submissions made recently. In different browsing styles, you can choose to see the best and well established recent threads of recent, or get in on the new discussion as it starts.</p></li>
<li><p>Before you submit a question that is a spinoff of a current hot thread, check in the /New/ queue, or search, to see if it has already been asked first.  Popular questions often generate spinoffs, but repeated questions asked ad nauseum aren&#39;t well received and won&#39;t offer much quality feedback.</p></li>

<li>Beneath the comment or text box is a link that will take you to formatting tips, to show you how to make sure your post is best displayed on reddit.  For a more in depth look at it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/" rel="nofollow"><strong>here is a pretty easy, but extensive, guide.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wiki_--spoiler_tags--">--Spoiler Tags--</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have spoiler tags! Use them! Here&#39;s how: [Text you want visible](#s &quot;text you want hidden&quot;) Example: <a href="#s" title="But this is the spoiler" rel="nofollow">This is visible </a>.<br/></li>
<li>The other spoiler tag often used around reddit is [spoiler](/s&quot;like this&quot;) and makes it look like a blacked out link. Once you mouse over it, you&#39;ll see the spoiler in the link preview. <a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/s%22Got%20it?%22" rel="nofollow">Spoiler</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wiki_--editing_and_mobile_browsing--">--Editing and mobile browsing--</h2>
<p>You are unable to edit a post title, you&#39;ll need to delete and resubmit with the corrected title for that. You can, however, edit the text box of a submission.  </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>--Editing Posts and Comments--</strong> To do this on a computer, under around the post title and text box, as well as under a comment box, you should see a button that says &#39;edit&#39;, or looks like a pen or pencil in a bubble. Clicking that should open a little menu with the options to allow you to change your text as necessary, and click &#39;save&#39;.  If you click &#39;delete&#39;, it will delete the entire submission. Various mobile apps for reddit have different ways to edit the self-text of a post. Most of these apps have a subreddit dedicated specifically to them where you can find help. Here&#39;s a little more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/wiki/iphone#wiki_editing_the_text_of_a_self_post" rel="nofollow">Alien Blue for iPhone/Apple.</a>.

<li>Reddit is Fun: consult any app support/info page, or see <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun" rel="nofollow">/r/redditisfun</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Herddit: see <strong><a href="/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit.com/r/herddit" rel="nofollow">/r/herddit</a></strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>--Mobile Browsing and The sidebar</strong>-- The sidebar of most subreddits is not visible when using an app for a mobile device.  To see the sidebar for a subreddit, you can visit a direct link to it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://www.reddit/r/subredditname/about/sidebar" rel="nofollow">www.reddit/r/subredditname/about/sidebar</a>, or you can navigate there through different channels on your app.  Typically there is a &#39;sidebar&#39; link, or an &#39;info&#39; button (that looks like an &#39;i&#39; in a circle).  This will bring up a menu showing the contents and important links located in the sidebar. Here&#39;s some pictures to help out, just find which app you have in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106071940/http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0" rel="nofollow"><strong>this gallery</strong></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s pretty important to be aware of the sidebar, as that&#39;s where the rules, submit links or message the mods buttons, and other important information is located.</p>

    <textarea readonly class="source" rows="20" cols="20">###New Redditors:

Welcome! For starters, for the love of all that is holy, READ THE [**RULES**](http://www.reddit.com/rules) and [**Reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette).  And if you ever need reference for something regarding Reddit as a whole, check out the [**/r/help FAQ Page**](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#toc_1). For a general rundown, kind of 'Reddit-Culture FAQ', [**this askreddit thread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1di229/what_are_some_things_you_dont_know_about_reddit/) gives a good summary of things.  Or if you missed a running joke or event on reddit and are now completely confused, **/r/outoftheloop** can help bring you up to speed.

###What is Reddit and how does it work?

Reddit is a website comprised of thousands of user-originated and operated communities, called 'subreddits', or 'subs', dedicated to a variety of interests.  Some of these subreddits allow for posting of pictures, videos, articles, and other links, while others allow for only 'self-posts', posts that do not redirect away from the page.  The website as a whole is operated by the 'Administrators', or 'Admins', who oversee the official business operations. Subreddits are operated by '[Moderators](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/moderation)', or 'Mods', who perform a variety of functions within that community, including removing spam and determining and enforcing the rules of their subreddit.

Posts and comments accrue votes, or points, called 'karma'.  **To discourage outside monitoring and spamming, the system fuzzes the karma count on posts to a degree.**  The ratio of upvotes and downvotes tends to be muddied a little (and roughly sits around +65% on popular posts), but this does not affect the sorting. A top post is still a top post.

Karma is generally a measure of the perception of your contribution to reddit. Positive karma would indicate your fellow users regarded your comments or posts as enjoyable and contributory to the subreddit.  It is otherwise meaningless, you can't *use* it for anything, so there's no real reason to try to acquire it. Your primary focus should really be just participating in the various communities and enjoying yourself and the interaction with your fellow redditors. 

There are two types of karma: 'Link karma' and 'comment karma'. Link karma is only given to posts that redirect away from that reddit page, links to other subreddits or other domains.  Self-posts are not awarded link karma.  'Comment karma' is the karma awarded to comments. The count is not always an up-to-the-minute score of your various comments, as the internal system doesn't always keep up immediately, but it will get there soon enough.  Sometimes, technical issues will cause the karma score to lag, as well as other issues with visibility of posting an comments, but these are usually sorted out quickly enough.

The [**Official Reddit FAQ**](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) and the [**/r/Help FAQ**](/r/help/wiki/faq) go into a much more in-depth explanation of reddit and any further questions you may have.

--------
#What is AskReddit?

AskReddit is a default subreddit, meaning you are automatically subscribed to it when you create your account.  The focus of this subreddit is to ask and answer questions that elicit thought-provoking discussions, as well as some lighter questions which will hopefully entertain and help you learn a little about your fellow redditors. 

Only self posts are allowed, and we prefer your questions to shine the focus on a topic other than yourself.  If you wish to tell a story, or seek advice pertaining to you or your situation, please consider posting in another subreddit first if it might be more appropriate elsewhere. Additionally, if you're seeking feedback from a specific demographic or profession, search to see if there is a specific subreddit dedicated to that field. [**Subreddit Search**](http://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search) or **/r/findareddit** can help you with that.

We currently have over 6.2 million subscribers, and that number is constantly rising by several thousand each day. Because of this, we average nearly 2 million unique hits a day, and over 150 million pageviews per month. You can see our [full traffic stats here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic)

#Rules

**Rules of the subreddit:**  Every subreddit has a unique set of rules regarding posting, comments, and general behavior acceptable there.  These are typically listed in the sidebar, often along with the FAQs and other recommended sites or subreddits. Please take note of them in every subreddit you visit.

The rules for AskReddit are as follows:

## -Rule 1-

* **1. a)** You must post a clear and direct question, **and only the question, in your title.** Any context, clarification, or conditions should be posted in the text box.

If you wish to tag your post NSFW, either put **only** the letters 'NSFW' before or after the post, or use the tagger button.  Introductory statements or claims,  'baiting'  devices like 'Possibly NSFW', or non question-related information such as 'I'll start...' are a violation of this rule, and will result in the post being removed. You need to have a question mark in your question and titles containing more than one sentence will likely be removed. 

  **b)**  **Any answers to the question, including your own, should go in the comments as a reply to your own post.** Use the text box to explain your question if necessary, but do not use it to share an answer. This is to allow for users to distinguish between the question being asked, and its answers, when voting.


## -Rule 2-

* **2)**  Any post asking for advice should be **generic** and **not specific to your situation alone**. You may include context about why you are asking the question in the text box, **but the question shouldn't be primarily about you**. 

In AskReddit, your title should always be about the question itself. If the question is focused on your personal story or is only relevant to your experience, it is not suitable for AskReddit. If you wish to receive advice on a specific topic, there are several options listed in the sidebar. 

## -Rule 3-

* **3)** **Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions**. Questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls and surveys, etc.) are not appropriate.

We are not a replacement for google. We are here to engage in constructive and entertaining discussion. Posts that do not promote such qualities may be removed. Crowdsourcing naming decisions, purchases, etc, is not appropriate. Either/or, [&quot;would you rather&quot;](/r/wouldyourather), or A/B posts also constitute as polls. Also prohibited are posts seeking to compile NSFW-links (as top-level comments). Such posts are not conducive to active discussion, and there are other subreddits where they would be more appreciated.

## -Rule 4-

* **4) Posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information will result in a ban without a prior warning. This includes for yourself or other people, and refers to, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook or other social media accounts.**

Regardless of intent, posting any information under the premise of being personally identifiable information is prohibited, and the person posting the information will be banned from the subreddit. This is a protective measure, because we cannot verify the accuracy of what is posted, nor defend against any unsavory intentions other users might have. 

## -Rule 5-

* **5) AskReddit is not your soapbox, personal army, or advertising platform.** Posts attempting to promote a specific agenda of yours or anyone else, to gain publicity, promote a cause or charity drive, or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed.  Rhetorical and loaded questions will also be removed.

This isn't a place to recruit members for a cause, highlight an individual or entity for positive or negative publicity, or toot your own horn.  Also, do not make posts or edits asking for upvotes or downvotes. Attempting to gain support for a movement, rig a contest, or form a vote brigade on reddit will result in immediate post removal. We're not here to do your bidding.

## -Rule 6-

* **6)** **Questions seeking professional advice are inappropriate for this subreddit and will be removed.** This includes but is not limited to medical, legal, mental health and financial advice. If you think that you need professional support, please contact a professional in your area as the qualifications of anyone giving advice on reddit can not be verified.

If it's serious enough for you to ask Reddit, it's serious enough for you to see a professional about it. 

## -Rule 7-

* **7) Soliciting money, goods, services, or favors are not allowed. They will be removed.**

This ties back in with rules 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Gaining publicity for a charity drive, assistance with a homework or work assignment, or asking other redditors to provide you with a good or service, is not conducive to discussion. There are other subreddits, many listed in our [**Offers &amp; Assistance Multi-reddit**](http://www.reddit.com/user/AskReddit_Multis/m/offers_assistance), for just such a thing.

## -Rule 8-

* **8) Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.** All users are expected to be **respectful** to other users at all times. Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans.

Please be aware that this is a site on the internet that hosts anonymous users.  Thick skin is required.

That said, don't be abusive or harass other users. If it is deemed that your conduct is detrimental to the experience of other users, your posting privileges will be revoked. Unmarked NSFW pictures, spam, and the likes will also be removed.  

Bans may be issued to users who disregard this rule.   

## -Rule 9-

* **9) Comment replies consisting solely of images will be removed.**

Child comments (comment replies to other comments), that consist only of a link to an image/video will be removed.  Links as part of a larger sentence giving context will still be permitted.  For example, 

&gt;\[random sentence made a link](http://www.reaction.gif) 

or

&gt;http://www.imgur.com/jpg

Will be removed, but a comment like this:

&gt;Here is an example of a comment containing a \[link](http://www.imgur.com/jpg).

will still be permitted. This is to prevent long chains of pictures, videos, or gifs that derail and detract from the conversation more than they contribute or progress it. Askreddit is a self-post only community focusing on discussion, and such comment replies only serve to derail the conversation, and are often 'spam' in nature.

## -Rule 10-

* **10) If you think your post has disappeared, see spam or an inappropriate post, please do not hesitate to contact one of the mods, we're happy to help.**

The community works much better when everyone works together to keep the place running smooth as possible.

#Thread Tags

Askreddit is working on expanding tags, or 'link flair' to designate certain posts as having certain topics or qualities.  These will come with a colored tag that expands to explain a little more when you mouse over the bar on the side. Unfortunately this is a product of the CSS, so many mobile apps and users with the Subreddit Style turned off will be unable to see this, however the tag will usually be put in the title in [brackets] as well, for easy indication to those unable to see the CSS.

## --[Serious] Tags--

This tag designates the thread is is applied to as a serious post, off-limits for joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion. If the OP asks for answers from a specific group, top level comments must be made from members of that group. Other responses will be removed. To mark your thread as [Serious], simply put '[Serious]', in brackets, in the post title. AutoModerator will automatically assign the link flair, thoroughly indicating with both thread title and flair, that the post will be much more strictly moderated and that comments not pertaining to the discussion in a more serious manner are subject to removal. If you see an inappropriate comment in a [Serious] thread, please downvote and report it so that the mods can look it over.  Note that the 'report' button is not an 'I disagree' button or a super-downvote, it will simply flag it for the mods' attention, and the comment will be evaluated for removal then. Not every thread will be appropriate for a [Serious] tag, and may be removed if assigned inappropriately, and not every comment will warrant removal, but the mods will use their best discretion to determine the value of the content posted. 

## --[Stories] Tags--

This tag designates that the OP has asked for users to post detailed stories as top-level comments. The comment length is determined by character count (currently set at 750 characters, but may change as necessary), and is enforced by Automod.   To tag your post with this this tag, simply put '[Stories]', in brackets, in the title.  Automod will automatically assign the flair and begin enforcing the character count on post replies.  [See the Modpost about it here for further information](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2cqygu/modpost_announcing_a_new_type_of_post_stories/).

## --Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts--

The Breaking News tag and the Megathread tag is for mod use only and is used when a breaking news happens or an event is going on, respectively. These tags are used when the mods need to pool together questions in a single post so the sub doesn't get filled with posts about one specific subject. The reason for this is that a lot of users do not come to AskReddit for current events and many want the sub to function as normal without having to filter posts -- we do this as a way to cater to both sides, as people who want information on the current event can visit the Breaking News or Megathread post and the people who don't are able to browse the sub as they normally would. Mod Posts are for sub announcements which usually involve rule changes or asking for feedback. Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts are exempt from rule 1 and 2 as they serve a separate purpose to the sub compared to regular posts.

In Breaking News posts, users can post thoughts, questions and comments anywhere in the thread, the same applies to Mod Posts. In Megathreads, top-level comments are required to be questions and the top-level comments are meant to function as mini threads within the Megathread which is meant to be like a subreddit for that specific subject. The mods run Megathreads throughout the year. Examples are the Christmas, Halloween and back to school Megathreads. None of the Megathreads are considered [Serious] posts unless it is marked as such in the title.

#Tips and Tricks

* ***Please* avoid 'shotgunning' comments and 'karmafarming'**-    Both of these behaviors can constitute comment-spamming, which is against the sitewide rules on spamming, and can result a ban from the subreddit.  

* **Regarding bots and novelty accounts**:  Bots are not permitted in /r/askreddit.  By their nature, they are incapable of progressing the discussion because they are not active participants capable of offering different responses.  They are considered spam, even the 'helpful' ones, because they create more static noise in the thread than they contribute.  Novelty accounts are discouraged, and certain kinds of novelties are banned.  Novelties that make identical comments (like the 'only says lol' type) are considered spam for the same reasons bots are.  Novelties that are dynamic, can contribute to and progress the conversation by offering some degree of 'original content' are permitted. 

* Questions soliciting binary &quot;this or that&quot; answers including questions asking &quot;how many...&quot; **do not make good questions**. A good rule to live by is, &quot;Is there any conceivable way that I could answer this in only 5 characters?&quot; If the answer is yes, then you may want to revise your question. 

* Editing your post because you made it to the front page, or were gifted gold, or received more upvotes than ever before is *not* obligatory, please don't do it.

* Specific interests will likely have dedicated subreddits. Indeed, there are subreddits for everything.  [**Here is just a taste of all the various subreddits out there**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ModeratorDuck/wiki/subreddit_classification).  If you don't see something there that fits your interests, and can't find it in the sidebar of any subreddit, the subreddit **/r/findareddit** might be able to help. 

* If you have a question for a specific demographic of people, be it profession or geographic location, search to see if there is a specific subreddit for them. For examples, there is a **/r/teachers** for teachers, or **/r/military** for all things military.  Nearly every sizable location has a subreddit, too, including **/r/LasVegas**, **/r/NYC**, **/r/London**, etc.  Even whole states and countries have subreddits dedicated to them. The [**subreddit search**](http://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search) or **/r/findareddit** can help you locate the most relevant one, and many subreddits also plug related subreddits in their sidebar, so be sure to take note of those as well.

* Searching by keyword in the search box can return popular posts made in the past.  You can narrow the results by time frame (day/week/month/year/all time), as well as sort by certain post criteria(relevance, new, top, comments).  The answer or discussion you're looking for may already be in one of those threads, or it can just be fun to revisit past topics. You can also take a look at [**some of the most commonly asked questions**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/commonquestions) to find out whether your question has already been asked.

* You can browse subreddits several different ways. You can start on the front page, which shows the current most popular threads, or you can browse in the /New/ queue.  The 'rising' sorting in the /New/ queue shows current trending submissions made recently. In different browsing styles, you can choose to see the best and well established recent threads of recent, or get in on the new discussion as it starts.

* Before you submit a question that is a spinoff of a current hot thread, check in the /New/ queue, or search, to see if it has already been asked first.  Popular questions often generate spinoffs, but repeated questions asked ad nauseum aren't well received and won't offer much quality feedback.

## --Formatting--
* Beneath the comment or text box is a link that will take you to formatting tips, to show you how to make sure your post is best displayed on reddit.  For a more in depth look at it, [**here is a pretty easy, but extensive, guide.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/)

## --Spoiler Tags--
* We have spoiler tags! Use them! Here's how: \[Text you want visible](#s &quot;text you want hidden&quot;) Example: [This is visible ](#s &quot;But this is the spoiler&quot;).  
* The other spoiler tag often used around reddit is \[spoiler](/s&quot;like this&quot;) and makes it look like a blacked out link. Once you mouse over it, you'll see the spoiler in the link preview. [Spoiler](/s&quot;Got it?&quot;)

## --Editing and mobile browsing--  

You are unable to edit a post title, you'll need to delete and resubmit with the corrected title for that. You can, however, edit the text box of a submission.  

* **--Editing Posts and Comments--** To do this on a computer, under around the post title and text box, as well as under a comment box, you should see a button that says 'edit', or looks like a pen or pencil in a bubble. Clicking that should open a little menu with the options to allow you to change your text as necessary, and click 'save'.  If you click 'delete', it will delete the entire submission. Various mobile apps for reddit have different ways to edit the self-text of a post. Most of these apps have a subreddit dedicated specifically to them where you can find help. Here's a little more information:
 * [Alien Blue for iPhone/Apple.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/wiki/iphone#wiki_editing_the_text_of_a_self_post). Also see **/r/alienblue**.
 * Baconreader: consult any app support/info page, or see **/r/baconreader**.
 * Reddit is Fun: consult any app support/info page, or see **/r/redditisfun**.
 * Herddit: see **/r/herddit**.

* **--Mobile Browsing and The sidebar**-- The sidebar of most subreddits is not visible when using an app for a mobile device.  To see the sidebar for a subreddit, you can visit a direct link to it, www.reddit/r/subredditname/about/sidebar, or you can navigate there through different channels on your app.  Typically there is a 'sidebar' link, or an 'info' button (that looks like an 'i' in a circle).  This will bring up a menu showing the contents and important links located in the sidebar. Here's some pictures to help out, just find which app you have in [**this gallery**](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

It's pretty important to be aware of the sidebar, as that's where the rules, submit links or message the mods buttons, and other important information is located.

The important ones are documented here.

We try to catalog them here, so you can see what you missed.
