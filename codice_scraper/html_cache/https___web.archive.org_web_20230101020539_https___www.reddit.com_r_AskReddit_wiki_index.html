<h3 id="wiki_what_is_reddit_and_how_does_it_work.3F">What is Reddit and how does it work?</h3>
<p>Reddit is a website comprised of thousands of user-originated and operated communities, called &#39;subreddits&#39;, or &#39;subs&#39;, dedicated to a variety of interests.  Some of these subreddits allow for posting of pictures, videos, articles, and other links, while others allow for only &#39;self-posts&#39;, posts that do not redirect away from the page.  The website as a whole is operated by the &#39;Administrators&#39;, or &#39;Admins&#39;, who oversee the official business operations. Subreddits are operated by &#39;<a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moderation" rel="nofollow">Moderators</a>&#39;, or &#39;Mods&#39;, who perform a variety of functions within that community, including removing spam and determining and enforcing the rules of their subreddit.</p>
<p>Posts and comments accrue votes, or points, called &#39;karma&#39;.  <strong>To discourage outside monitoring and spamming, the system fuzzes the karma count on posts to a degree.</strong>  The ratio of upvotes and downvotes tends to be muddied a little (and roughly sits around +65% on popular posts), but this does not affect the sorting. A top post is still a top post.</p>
<p>Karma is generally a measure of the perception of your contribution to reddit. Positive karma would indicate your fellow users regarded your comments or posts as enjoyable and contributory to the subreddit.  It is otherwise meaningless, you can&#39;t <em>use</em> it for anything, so there&#39;s no real reason to try to acquire it. Your primary focus should really be just participating in the various communities and enjoying yourself and the interaction with your fellow redditors. Keep in mind that the point to karma ratio is not 1:1, meaning that your karma will not be equal to the number of points you have received on your posts. </p>
<p>The <a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq" rel="nofollow"><strong>Official Reddit FAQ</strong></a> and the <a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq" rel="nofollow"><strong>r/Help FAQ</strong></a> go into a much more in-depth explanation of reddit and any further questions you may have.</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="wiki_what_is_askreddit.3F">What is AskReddit?</h1>
<p>The focus of this subreddit is to ask and answer questions that elicit thought-provoking discussions, as well as some lighter questions which will hopefully entertain and help you learn a little about your fellow redditors.  Only self posts are allowed, and we prefer your questions to shine the focus on a topic other than yourself.  </p>
<p>If you wish to tell a story, or seek advice pertaining to you or your situation, please consider posting in another subreddit first if it might be more appropriate elsewhere. Additionally, if you&#39;re seeking feedback from a specific demographic or profession, search to see if there is a specific subreddit dedicated to that field. <a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search" rel="nofollow"><strong>Subreddit Search</strong></a> or <strong><a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/r/FindAReddit" rel="nofollow">r/FindAReddit</a></strong> can help you with that.</p>
<p>We currently have over 36 million subscribers, and that number is constantly rising by several thousand each day. </p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="wiki_rules">Rules</h1>
<p><strong>Rules of the subreddit:</strong>  Every subreddit has a unique set of rules regarding posting, comments, and general behavior acceptable there.  These are typically listed in the sidebar, often along with the FAQs and other recommended sites or subreddits. Please take note of them in every subreddit you visit. Your content may be removed and/or you may be banned for violating any of the following rules and guidelines. </p>
<p>The rules for AskReddit are as follows:</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-harmful_misinformation-">-Harmful Misinformation-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reminder: Reddit does not allow for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151" rel="nofollow">harmful health misinformation</a> as part of its policy against posting violent content</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Redditors who attempt to spread harmful misinformation that affects large populations will have their posts and comments removed, and may be banned from the subreddit in the case of excessive or extremely harmful content regarding this topic. This includes:</p>

<li><p>Downplaying the harmful effects of a current medical crisis which impacts a large population</p></li>
<li><p>Undermining widespread agreement among the medical and scientific communities regarding the efficacy of vaccines or other life-saving practices that prevent death during a health pandemic or crises,</p></li>
<li><p>Encouragement of law-breaking activities</p></li>
<li><p>Any other content that can be interpreted as having the potential to delay someone from seeking medical attention, or pushing an agenda to act on otherwise harmful misinformation</p></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>1) You must post a clear and direct question in the title.</strong> <strong><em>The post may contain up to two, short context sentences only if they are necessary for understanding the question.</em></strong>  Your title must end with a question and a question mark. All posts must be written in English so that they are widely understood by the user base of the sub.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit" rel="nofollow">r/AskReddit</a>, <strong>we only allow post titles without use of the text box</strong> for further elaboration.

December 9th, 2015.</a></p>
<p><strong>Any examples that could otherwise stand as an answer to the question should go in the comments section, and not be a part of your title.</strong> This includes posting questions which list exceptions, for example: “Other than ___” or “Besides ____” posts.</p>
<p>If you wish to tag your post NSFW, either put <strong>only</strong> the letters &#39;NSFW&#39; before or after the post, or use the flair button. Introductory statements or claims, &#39;baiting&#39; devices like &#39;Possibly NSFW&#39;, or non question-related information such as &#39;I&#39;ll start...&#39; are a violation of this rule, and will result in the post being removed.

<li><strong>2) AskReddit is NOT your personal or professional advice platform.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any post asking for advice should be <strong>generic</strong> and <strong>not specific to your situation alone</strong>. Do not include first person pronouns in your title (&quot;I, &quot;Me&quot;, &quot;My&quot; etc.). In AskReddit, your title should always be about the question itself. If the question is focused on your personal story or is only relevant to your experience, it is not suitable for AskReddit. Crowdsourcing naming decisions, purchases, etc, is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Questions seeking professional advice are inappropriate for this subreddit and will be removed.</strong> This includes but is not limited to medical, legal, mental health, and financial advice. If you think that you need professional support, please contact a professional as the qualifications of anyone giving advice on reddit can not be verified.
If it&#39;s serious enough for you to ask Reddit, it&#39;s serious enough for you to see a professional about it.</p>

<h2 id="wiki_-rule_3-">-Rule 3-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions</strong>. Questions that already have a definite/correct answer OR may be researched easily (for example through Google) cannot be asked here.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not a replacement for Google. We are here to engage in constructive and entertaining discussion. Posts that do not promote such qualities may be removed. <strong>Questions that will have definite answers or limit responses to fewer than 3 words are not allowed.</strong> This includes Yes/No, DAE, Either/or, &quot;would you rather&quot;, polls, surveys and fill-in-the-blank questions. <strong>You must ask for an explanation beyond a one word reply, such as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</strong> Any other questions that limit word length, provide a small choice of responses, or ask for a brand name or title within a category without further elaboration will be removed. <strong>Also prohibited are posts seeking to compile NSFW-links</strong> (as top-level comments). Such posts are not conducive to active discussion, and there are other subreddits where they would be more appreciated.</p>
<p>Threads in which many of the responses are the same discourage discussion and will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) post titles that begin with &quot;How Would You Feel...&quot; in which the post is leading individuals to largely agree or disagree with a concept without adding to the conversation, and where your own personal bias may be apparent in the content of the post title</p>
<p>Threads in which the first commenter is required to give one answer and the second commenter needs to add on in some way or argue the opposite point are not allowed because they tend to limit discussion by requiring what child comments can say.</p>

<li>4) Posting or seeking any identifying <strong>personal information, real or fake, will result in a ban without a prior warning.</strong> This includes information about yourself or other people and refers to, but is not limited to: names, phone numbers, email addresses, or social media. <strong>Asking questions designed to draw attention to specific usernames</strong> related to social media, or posting comments to call out another Reddit user are also not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of intent, posting any information under the premise of being personally identifiable information is prohibited, and the person posting the information will be banned from the subreddit. This is a protective measure, because we cannot verify the accuracy of what is posted, nor defend against any unsavory intentions other users might have.</p>
<h4 id="wiki_exceptions_to_rule_4">Exceptions to Rule 4</h4>
<p><strong>The following exceptions are allowed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>US phone numbers with <em>555</em> as the first 3 digits after the area code</p></li>
<li><p>@example.com email addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Health and helpline resources that are explicitly mentioned as such.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Rule 4 also applies to posting a user&#39;s history. It&#39;s permissible to link to a relevant comment from another thread or even another sub, but against the rules to post a link to something, even in the same thread, if it encourages going into that user&#39;s history or launching a personal attack. &quot;Here&#39;s a relevant comment&quot; comments are fine, but &quot;Look at what I found in this user&#39;s history! See what else you can find&quot; comments are not.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_5-">-Rule 5-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>5) Rhetorical and loaded questions</strong> (in which you are asserting an opinion, bias, or leading respondents towards expressing a specific opinion) will be removed. <strong>AskReddit is not your soapbox, personal army, or advertising platform.</strong> Posts attempting to promote a specific agenda, to gain publicity, promote a cause or charity drive, or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) &quot;How Would You Feel...&quot; threads in which your own personal opinion may be apparent in the post title. Posts asking users to shame or call out specific people or groups will be removed because they lead to witch-hunting rather than discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#39;t a place to recruit members for a cause, highlight an individual or entity for positive or negative publicity, or toot your own horn. Attempting to gain support for a movement, rig a contest, or form a vote brigade to other posts or comments on Reddit will result in immediate post removal.

<li><strong>6)</strong> <strong>-[Serious] Tags--</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This tag designates the thread it is applied to is a serious post, off-limits for joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion. If the OP asks for answers from a specific group, top level comments must be made from members of that group. Other responses will be removed. To mark your thread as [Serious], simply put &#39;[Serious]&#39;, in brackets, in the post title. AutoModerator will automatically assign the link flair, thoroughly indicating with both thread title and flair, that the post will be much more strictly moderated and that comments not pertaining to the discussion in a more serious manner are subject to removal. This includes every single comment (parent or child) in the thread. If you see an inappropriate comment in a [Serious] thread, please report it so that the mods can look it over. Note that the &#39;report&#39; button is not an &#39;I disagree&#39; button or a super-downvote, it will simply flag it for the mods&#39; attention, and the comment will be evaluated for removal then. Mods will reserve the discretion to determine if a post is suited for a Serious tag. If there are no relevant answers within the first hour of posting, a [Serious] thread may be removed. Consider doing an AMA request instead! Novelty accounts are not permitted in serious threads.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_7-">-Rule 7-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>7) Soliciting money, goods, services, or favours are not allowed.</strong> They will be removed. <strong>Asking for Reddit rewards will warrant a ban.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Gaining publicity for a charity drive, assistance with a homework or work assignment, asking other Redditors for or offering to provide a good or service (including upvotes or reddit gold) is not conducive to discussion. There are other subreddits, many listed in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/user/AskReddit_Multis/m/offers_assistance" rel="nofollow">Offers &amp; Assistance Multi-reddit</a>, for just such a thing. Doing this, even as a joke, can result in a ban.</p>
<p><strong>Brigading from other posts or comments, even from other subreddits, to an AskReddit post or comment may result in a ban.</strong> Brigading occurs when you make any attempt to direct online traffic to a post or comment for either positive or negative interaction with the content, including, but not limited to: asking for downvotes or upvotes, drawing in supporters to join a comment chain, or encouraging others to negatively interact with another user by linking to the AskReddit post or comment. Extreme cases of brigading will result in a permanent ban.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>8) All users are expected to be respectful to other users at all times and conduct their behaviour in a civil manner.</strong> Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slur use is not allowed in AskReddit. Exceptions may be made when they are part of a quote, but this is a friendly subreddit and using slurs when talking to others will not be tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t be abusive or harass other users.</strong> Do not make blatant statements of bigotry, such as &quot;I hate gays&quot; or &quot;Black people suck&quot;. <strong>Do not make jokes or statements that sexualize minors</strong>, as we have zero tolerance for this behaviour and you will be banned. <strong>Do not encourage suicide in any form</strong>, through humour or otherwise. Continuing arguments with other users over multiple comments is termed <strong>&quot;slapfighting&quot;</strong> and not allowed. Such behaviour may lead to comment removals and bans. In summary, <strong>any post or comment that is deemed to be intended to offend, demean, or otherwise egregiously disrespect others may warrant a removal or ban.</strong></p>
<p>Comments and posts mentioning subreddits and websites deemed to be harmful, because of demeaning content, spam, etc., will be filtered. Unmarked NSFW links, unmarked spoilers, misleading links, spam, and the likes will will result in removal and potentially a ban. Editing comments and posts to mislead and/or advertise will result in removal of the post/comment and potentially a ban.</p>
<p><strong>Shotgunning</strong>, in which you are making low-effort comments in reply to top-level comments in high frequency, is not allowed. <strong>Karmafarming</strong>, in which you are making low-effort comments or posts (including copying and pasting old comments or previously popular posts) for the majority of your contribution to the sub, is also prohibited. Mod actions in response to karmafarming are generally reserved for users taking low effort comments to an extreme. Users with a majority of low effort comments or posts that add little to the conversation may be banned.</p>
<p>Bans may be issued to users who disregard this rule.</p>
<h2 id="wiki_-rule_9-">-Rule 9-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>9) Comment replies consisting solely of images will be removed.</strong> ASCII images over one line are also not allowed. You may post single line emoticons (ಠ◡ಠ, ʘ‿ʘ, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , etc.), but large ASCII images and vertical text do not add value to discussion and will be treated as spam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Child comments (comment replies to other comments), that consist only of a link to an image/video will be removed.  Links as part of a larger sentence giving context will still be permitted.  For example, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[random sentence made a link](<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101020539/http://www.reaction.gif/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reaction.gif</a>) </p>

<p>Will be removed, but a comment like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is an example of a comment containing a [link](<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101020539/http://www.imgur.com/jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imgur.com/jpg</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will still be permitted. This is to prevent long chains of pictures, videos, or gifs that derail and detract from the conversation more than they contribute or progress it. Askreddit is a self-post only community focusing on discussion, and such comment replies only serve to derail the conversation, and are often &#39;spam&#39; in nature.</p>

<h2 id="wiki_--breaking_news.2C_megathreads.2C_and_mod_posts--">--Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts--</h2>
<p>The Breaking News tag and the Megathread tag is for mod use only and is used when a breaking news happens or an event is going on, respectively. These tags are used when the mods need to pool together questions in a single post so the sub doesn&#39;t get filled with posts about one specific subject. The reason for this is that a lot of users do not come to AskReddit for current events and many want the sub to function as normal without having to filter posts. People who want information on an emerging topic can visit the stickied post. Mod Posts are for sub announcements which usually involve rule changes or asking for feedback. Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts are exempt from rule 1 and 2 as they serve a separate purpose to the sub compared to regular posts.</p>
<p>In Breaking News posts, users can post thoughts, questions and comments anywhere in the thread, the same applies to Mod Posts. In Megathreads, top-level comments are required to be questions meant to function as mini threads within the Megathread. The mods run Megathreads throughout the year.</p>

<li><p><strong>Regarding bots and novelty accounts:</strong> Bots are not permitted in <a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit" rel="nofollow">r/AskReddit</a>. By their nature, they are incapable of progressing the discussion. Novelty accounts are discouraged, and certain kinds of novelties are banned. Bots and non-dynamic novelties are considered spam. Novelties that are dynamic, can contribute to and progress the conversation by offering some degree of &#39;original content&#39; are permitted. Novelty accounts are not permitted in serious threads.

<li><p>Searching by keyword in the search box can return popular posts made in the past. You can narrow the results by time frame (day/week/month/year/all time), as well as sort by certain post criteria(relevance, new, top, comments). You can also browse subreddits by the new post listing.

Popular questions often generate spinoffs, but repeated questions asked ad nauseum aren&#39;t well received and won&#39;t offer much quality feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wiki_--ban_messages_and_modmail--">--Ban Messages and Modmail--</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bans are issued by a person, and never done automatically. Whenever a user receives a ban, they are to reply to that message for further clarification on why it was issued. Users caught intentionally trying to get around the bot or spam filter are subject to a permanent ban. Typically, bans are not permanent, but we will have a discussion to ensure that if the ban is lifted, you are able to understand and follow the rules. Ban messages and communication (modmail) with askreddit mods should remain a private matter between the two parties. Discussing your ban outside of the modmail thread will result in a permanent ban. Mods are volunteers, donating their time and effort to improve the community. When users discuss their ban elsewhere in an effort to rally against the team it causes unnecessary backlash over a simple infraction</li>

<li>Some threads in <a href="/web/20230101020539/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit" rel="nofollow">r/AskReddit</a> have their comments sorted differently by default to encourage certain kinds of activity.

    <textarea readonly class="source" rows="20" cols="20">###New Redditors:

Welcome! For starters, for the love of all that is holy, READ THE [**RULES**](/rules) and [**Reddiquette**](/help/reddiquette).  And if you ever need reference for something regarding Reddit as a whole, check out the [**r/help FAQ Page**](/r/help/wiki/faq#toc_1). For a general rundown, kind of 'Reddit-Culture FAQ', [**this AskReddit thread**](/r/AskReddit/comments/1di229/what_are_some_things_you_dont_know_about_reddit/) gives a good summary of things.  Or if you missed a running joke or event on reddit and are now completely confused, **r/OutOfTheLoop** can help bring you up to speed.

--------
###What is Reddit and how does it work?

Reddit is a website comprised of thousands of user-originated and operated communities, called 'subreddits', or 'subs', dedicated to a variety of interests.  Some of these subreddits allow for posting of pictures, videos, articles, and other links, while others allow for only 'self-posts', posts that do not redirect away from the page.  The website as a whole is operated by the 'Administrators', or 'Admins', who oversee the official business operations. Subreddits are operated by '[Moderators](/wiki/moderation)', or 'Mods', who perform a variety of functions within that community, including removing spam and determining and enforcing the rules of their subreddit.

Posts and comments accrue votes, or points, called 'karma'.  **To discourage outside monitoring and spamming, the system fuzzes the karma count on posts to a degree.**  The ratio of upvotes and downvotes tends to be muddied a little (and roughly sits around +65% on popular posts), but this does not affect the sorting. A top post is still a top post.

Karma is generally a measure of the perception of your contribution to reddit. Positive karma would indicate your fellow users regarded your comments or posts as enjoyable and contributory to the subreddit.  It is otherwise meaningless, you can't *use* it for anything, so there's no real reason to try to acquire it. Your primary focus should really be just participating in the various communities and enjoying yourself and the interaction with your fellow redditors. Keep in mind that the point to karma ratio is not 1:1, meaning that your karma will not be equal to the number of points you have received on your posts. 

The [**Official Reddit FAQ**](/wiki/faq) and the [**r/Help FAQ**](/r/help/wiki/faq) go into a much more in-depth explanation of reddit and any further questions you may have.

--------
#What is AskReddit?

The focus of this subreddit is to ask and answer questions that elicit thought-provoking discussions, as well as some lighter questions which will hopefully entertain and help you learn a little about your fellow redditors.  Only self posts are allowed, and we prefer your questions to shine the focus on a topic other than yourself.  

If you wish to tell a story, or seek advice pertaining to you or your situation, please consider posting in another subreddit first if it might be more appropriate elsewhere. Additionally, if you're seeking feedback from a specific demographic or profession, search to see if there is a specific subreddit dedicated to that field. [**Subreddit Search**](/subreddits/search) or **r/FindAReddit** can help you with that.

We currently have over 36 million subscribers, and that number is constantly rising by several thousand each day.

**Rules of the subreddit:**  Every subreddit has a unique set of rules regarding posting, comments, and general behavior acceptable there.  These are typically listed in the sidebar, often along with the FAQs and other recommended sites or subreddits. Please take note of them in every subreddit you visit. Your content may be removed and/or you may be banned for violating any of the following rules and guidelines. 

The rules for AskReddit are as follows:

## -Harmful Misinformation-

* **Reminder: Reddit does not allow for [harmful health misinformation](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151) as part of its policy against posting violent content**

Redditors who attempt to spread harmful misinformation that affects large populations will have their posts and comments removed, and may be banned from the subreddit in the case of excessive or extremely harmful content regarding this topic. This includes:

* Downplaying the harmful effects of a current medical crisis which impacts a large population

* Undermining widespread agreement among the medical and scientific communities regarding the efficacy of vaccines or other life-saving practices that prevent death during a health pandemic or crises,

* Encouragement of law-breaking activities

* Any other content that can be interpreted as having the potential to delay someone from seeking medical attention, or pushing an agenda to act on otherwise harmful misinformation

## -Rule 1-

* **1) You must post a clear and direct question in the title.**  ***The post may contain up to two, short context sentences only if they are necessary for understanding the question.***  Your title must end with a question and a question mark. All posts must be written in English so that they are widely understood by the user base of the sub.

In r/AskReddit, **we only allow post titles without use of the text box** for further elaboration. You are welcome to add further explanation in addition to your title in the regular comments section. [&quot;No Text Box&quot; Rule Mod Post. December 9th, 2015.](/r/AskReddit/comments/3w0k5h/mod_post_new_rule_1_is_here_to_stay/)


**Any examples that could otherwise stand as an answer to the question should go in the comments section, and not be a part of your title.** This includes posting questions which list exceptions, for example: “Other than \_\_\_” or “Besides \_\_\_\_” posts.

If you wish to tag your post NSFW, either put **only** the letters 'NSFW' before or after the post, or use the flair button. Introductory statements or claims, 'baiting' devices like 'Possibly NSFW', or non question-related information such as 'I'll start...' are a violation of this rule, and will result in the post being removed.
Spelling errors that change the meaning of the question will be removed.

If you like posts which break rule 1, you might like [these subs](/r/AskReddit/wiki/related#wiki_rule_1).



## -Rule 2-

* **2) AskReddit is NOT your personal or professional advice platform.**

Any post asking for advice should be **generic** and **not specific to your situation alone**. Do not include first person pronouns in your title (&quot;I, &quot;Me&quot;, &quot;My&quot; etc.). In AskReddit, your title should always be about the question itself. If the question is focused on your personal story or is only relevant to your experience, it is not suitable for AskReddit. Crowdsourcing naming decisions, purchases, etc, is not appropriate.

**Questions seeking professional advice are inappropriate for this subreddit and will be removed.** This includes but is not limited to medical, legal, mental health, and financial advice. If you think that you need professional support, please contact a professional as the qualifications of anyone giving advice on reddit can not be verified.
If it's serious enough for you to ask Reddit, it's serious enough for you to see a professional about it.

If you wish to receive advice on a specific topic, you might like [these subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/related#wiki_rule_2).



## -Rule 3-

* **3)** **Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions**. Questions that already have a definite/correct answer OR may be researched easily (for example through Google) cannot be asked here.

We are not a replacement for Google. We are here to engage in constructive and entertaining discussion. Posts that do not promote such qualities may be removed. **Questions that will have definite answers or limit responses to fewer than 3 words are not allowed.** This includes Yes/No, DAE, Either/or, &quot;would you rather&quot;, polls, surveys and fill-in-the-blank questions. **You must ask for an explanation beyond a one word reply, such as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.** Any other questions that limit word length, provide a small choice of responses, or ask for a brand name or title within a category without further elaboration will be removed. **Also prohibited are posts seeking to compile NSFW-links** (as top-level comments). Such posts are not conducive to active discussion, and there are other subreddits where they would be more appreciated.

Threads in which many of the responses are the same discourage discussion and will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) post titles that begin with &quot;How Would You Feel...&quot; in which the post is leading individuals to largely agree or disagree with a concept without adding to the conversation, and where your own personal bias may be apparent in the content of the post title

Threads in which the first commenter is required to give one answer and the second commenter needs to add on in some way or argue the opposite point are not allowed because they tend to limit discussion by requiring what child comments can say.

If you like posts which break rule 3, you might like [these subs.](/r/AskReddit/wiki/related#wiki_rule_3)

## -Rule 4-

* 4) Posting or seeking any identifying **personal information, real or fake, will result in a ban without a prior warning.** This includes information about yourself or other people and refers to, but is not limited to: names, phone numbers, email addresses, or social media. **Asking questions designed to draw attention to specific usernames** related to social media, or posting comments to call out another Reddit user are also not allowed.

Regardless of intent, posting any information under the premise of being personally identifiable information is prohibited, and the person posting the information will be banned from the subreddit. This is a protective measure, because we cannot verify the accuracy of what is posted, nor defend against any unsavory intentions other users might have.

#### Exceptions to Rule 4

**The following exceptions are allowed:**

* US phone numbers with *555* as the first 3 digits after the area code

* @example.com email addresses

* Health and helpline resources that are explicitly mentioned as such.

**Please note:** Rule 4 also applies to posting a user's history. It's permissible to link to a relevant comment from another thread or even another sub, but against the rules to post a link to something, even in the same thread, if it encourages going into that user's history or launching a personal attack. &quot;Here's a relevant comment&quot; comments are fine, but &quot;Look at what I found in this user's history! See what else you can find&quot; comments are not.

## -Rule 5-

* **5) Rhetorical and loaded questions** (in which you are asserting an opinion, bias, or leading respondents towards expressing a specific opinion) will be removed. **AskReddit is not your soapbox, personal army, or advertising platform.** Posts attempting to promote a specific agenda, to gain publicity, promote a cause or charity drive, or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) &quot;How Would You Feel...&quot; threads in which your own personal opinion may be apparent in the post title. Posts asking users to shame or call out specific people or groups will be removed because they lead to witch-hunting rather than discussion.

This isn't a place to recruit members for a cause, highlight an individual or entity for positive or negative publicity, or toot your own horn. Attempting to gain support for a movement, rig a contest, or form a vote brigade to other posts or comments on Reddit will result in immediate post removal. We're not here to do your bidding.

If you like posts which break rule 5, you might like [these subs.](/r/AskReddit/wiki/related#wiki_rule_5)

## -Rule 6-

* **6)** **-[Serious] Tags--**

This tag designates the thread it is applied to is a serious post, off-limits for joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion. If the OP asks for answers from a specific group, top level comments must be made from members of that group. Other responses will be removed. To mark your thread as [Serious], simply put '[Serious]', in brackets, in the post title. AutoModerator will automatically assign the link flair, thoroughly indicating with both thread title and flair, that the post will be much more strictly moderated and that comments not pertaining to the discussion in a more serious manner are subject to removal. This includes every single comment (parent or child) in the thread. If you see an inappropriate comment in a [Serious] thread, please report it so that the mods can look it over. Note that the 'report' button is not an 'I disagree' button or a super-downvote, it will simply flag it for the mods' attention, and the comment will be evaluated for removal then. Mods will reserve the discretion to determine if a post is suited for a Serious tag. If there are no relevant answers within the first hour of posting, a [Serious] thread may be removed. Consider doing an AMA request instead! Novelty accounts are not permitted in serious threads.

## -Rule 7-

* **7) Soliciting money, goods, services, or favours are not allowed.** They will be removed. **Asking for Reddit rewards will warrant a ban.**

Gaining publicity for a charity drive, assistance with a homework or work assignment, asking other Redditors for or offering to provide a good or service (including upvotes or reddit gold) is not conducive to discussion. There are other subreddits, many listed in our [Offers &amp; Assistance Multi-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/AskReddit_Multis/m/offers_assistance), for just such a thing. Doing this, even as a joke, can result in a ban.

**Brigading from other posts or comments, even from other subreddits, to an AskReddit post or comment may result in a ban.** Brigading occurs when you make any attempt to direct online traffic to a post or comment for either positive or negative interaction with the content, including, but not limited to: asking for downvotes or upvotes, drawing in supporters to join a comment chain, or encouraging others to negatively interact with another user by linking to the AskReddit post or comment. Extreme cases of brigading will result in a permanent ban.

If you like posts which break rule 7, you might like [these subs.](/r/AskReddit/wiki/related#wiki_rule_7)

## -Rule 8-

* **8) All users are expected to be respectful to other users at all times and conduct their behaviour in a civil manner.** Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans.

Slur use is not allowed in AskReddit. Exceptions may be made when they are part of a quote, but this is a friendly subreddit and using slurs when talking to others will not be tolerated.

**Don't be abusive or harass other users.** Do not make blatant statements of bigotry, such as &quot;I hate gays&quot; or &quot;Black people suck&quot;. **Do not make jokes or statements that sexualize minors**, as we have zero tolerance for this behaviour and you will be banned. **Do not encourage suicide in any form**, through humour or otherwise. Continuing arguments with other users over multiple comments is termed **&quot;slapfighting&quot;** and not allowed. Such behaviour may lead to comment removals and bans. In summary, **any post or comment that is deemed to be intended to offend, demean, or otherwise egregiously disrespect others may warrant a removal or ban.**

Comments and posts mentioning subreddits and websites deemed to be harmful, because of demeaning content, spam, etc., will be filtered. Unmarked NSFW links, unmarked spoilers, misleading links, spam, and the likes will will result in removal and potentially a ban. Editing comments and posts to mislead and/or advertise will result in removal of the post/comment and potentially a ban.

**Shotgunning**, in which you are making low-effort comments in reply to top-level comments in high frequency, is not allowed. **Karmafarming**, in which you are making low-effort comments or posts (including copying and pasting old comments or previously popular posts) for the majority of your contribution to the sub, is also prohibited. Mod actions in response to karmafarming are generally reserved for users taking low effort comments to an extreme. Users with a majority of low effort comments or posts that add little to the conversation may be banned.

Bans may be issued to users who disregard this rule.


## -Rule 9-

* **9) Comment replies consisting solely of images will be removed.** ASCII images over one line are also not allowed. You may post single line emoticons (ಠ◡ಠ, ʘ‿ʘ, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ , etc.), but large ASCII images and vertical text do not add value to discussion and will be treated as spam.

Child comments (comment replies to other comments), that consist only of a link to an image/video will be removed.  Links as part of a larger sentence giving context will still be permitted.  For example, 

&gt; \[random sentence made a link](http://www.reaction.gif) 

or

&gt; http://www.imgur.com/jpg

Will be removed, but a comment like this:

&gt; Here is an example of a comment containing a \[link](http://www.imgur.com/jpg).

will still be permitted. This is to prevent long chains of pictures, videos, or gifs that derail and detract from the conversation more than they contribute or progress it. Askreddit is a self-post only community focusing on discussion, and such comment replies only serve to derail the conversation, and are often 'spam' in nature.

-------

If you think your post has disappeared, see spam or an inappropriate post, please do not hesitate to contact one of the mods, we're happy to help.

The community works much better when everyone works together to keep the place running smooth as possible.

#Thread Tags


## --Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts--

The Breaking News tag and the Megathread tag is for mod use only and is used when a breaking news happens or an event is going on, respectively. These tags are used when the mods need to pool together questions in a single post so the sub doesn't get filled with posts about one specific subject. The reason for this is that a lot of users do not come to AskReddit for current events and many want the sub to function as normal without having to filter posts. People who want information on an emerging topic can visit the stickied post. Mod Posts are for sub announcements which usually involve rule changes or asking for feedback. Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts are exempt from rule 1 and 2 as they serve a separate purpose to the sub compared to regular posts.

In Breaking News posts, users can post thoughts, questions and comments anywhere in the thread, the same applies to Mod Posts. In Megathreads, top-level comments are required to be questions meant to function as mini threads within the Megathread. The mods run Megathreads throughout the year.

--------

#Guidelines

* **Regarding bots and novelty accounts:** Bots are not permitted in r/AskReddit. By their nature, they are incapable of progressing the discussion. Novelty accounts are discouraged, and certain kinds of novelties are banned. Bots and non-dynamic novelties are considered spam. Novelties that are dynamic, can contribute to and progress the conversation by offering some degree of 'original content' are permitted. Novelty accounts are not permitted in serious threads. If you are unsure if your Reddit habits are considered spam, read more [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer).

* **[Here is just a taste of all the various subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/)** if AskReddit is not the place for you. If you don't see something there that fits your interests, and can't find it in the sidebar of any subreddit, the subreddit r/FindAReddit might be able to help.

* Searching by keyword in the search box can return popular posts made in the past. You can narrow the results by time frame (day/week/month/year/all time), as well as sort by certain post criteria(relevance, new, top, comments). You can also browse subreddits by the new post listing. The 'rising' sorting in [the new post listing](https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/new) shows current trending submissions made recently.

* Before you submit a question that is a spinoff of a current hot thread, check in [the new post listing](https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/new), or search, to see if it has already been asked first. Popular questions often generate spinoffs, but repeated questions asked ad nauseum aren't well received and won't offer much quality feedback.

## --Ban Messages and Modmail--
* Bans are issued by a person, and never done automatically. Whenever a user receives a ban, they are to reply to that message for further clarification on why it was issued. Users caught intentionally trying to get around the bot or spam filter are subject to a permanent ban. Typically, bans are not permanent, but we will have a discussion to ensure that if the ban is lifted, you are able to understand and follow the rules. Ban messages and communication (modmail) with askreddit mods should remain a private matter between the two parties. Discussing your ban outside of the modmail thread will result in a permanent ban. Mods are volunteers, donating their time and effort to improve the community. When users discuss their ban elsewhere in an effort to rally against the team it causes unnecessary backlash over a simple infraction


## --Suggested Sort--
* Some threads in r/AskReddit have their comments sorted differently by default to encourage certain kinds of activity. Megathreads have their comment sort set to &quot;new&quot; by default to ensure that new comments are viewed by others, even when the thread is old.

## --Formatting--
* If you are confused about how to format your comments, including basic text, inserting links, or masking spoilers try reviewing this [helpful guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/)

## --Editing--  
* You are unable to edit a post title, you'll need to delete and resubmit with the corrected title 

## --Mobile Browsing--  
* To discuss issues with any of the Reddit Apps, see r/RedditMobile

* If your questions cannot be answered, try the [help guide for mobile apps](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-apps)
